South Pole Blog - It's really happening!

<h1>Captain's Web Log(2) - 6 Nov 2015 - It's really happening!!! </h1>
AAAAAAAAAAA!!!
<br><br>

I just got an email from USAP, and I have officially physically qualified (PQed) to winter at the pole.  That pretty much means this is for-sure happening (though
I still haven't gotten anything in writing, or an official offer letter, or anything like that... but hey, what do you expect from academics?  Administrative efficiency?
certainly not!).  

<br><br>

So now I just have to finish my experiment in two months, get everything I'll need to bring, get organized, sublet my apartment, pack up all my stuff, move out, 
and there you have it.  Easy-peasy, right?  hah.  I don't think it's totally sunk in yet, but I can feel my inner obsessive list maker awakening.
