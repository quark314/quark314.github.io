    <ol>
    
    <li> Finish your PhD experiment (minor detail)</li>
    <li> Download every episode of This American Life, Radiolab,  -  </li>
    <li> Download all of wikipedia - Cause who whats to break their wikipedia addiction? Not you.  Turns out it's only around 12 GB compressed, 49 uncompressed, without images.  </li>
    <li> Sell or donate most of your furniture </li>
    <li> Sort all of your stuff into four piles:  Pack up and store in one of those ship-and-store containers, take to south pole, leave in Christchurch (you can leave some stuff locked up at the place where they
        issue the extreme cold weather gear; summer clothes, for instance), leave at parent's house (you may find when you return to the US in November that you wish you had your normal
        winter gear and not just your south pole gear, but that ship-and-store container isn't going to show up for who knows how long). </li>
    <li> Scan all of your lab notebooks and get digital copies of your favorite text books - gotta be prepared to write your dissertation while you're on the ice.  Luckily, your
          SPT winterover compatriot has gotten permission to download and bring a copy of the entire arXiv.  </li>

    So you've got the job, you've been physically qualified... now what? <br>
    Well now you've got to tie up all the loose ends in your life and get everything in your life ready to put on hold for almost a year.  
    <br><br>
    
    For me, the biggest thing is finishing up the experiment I'm currently working on.  I've got just a month and a half left, so it's
    going to be a tight squeeze.  I'll talk more about the science I've been doing over the past few years in a future blog post.  Outside
    of that, I also have to find someone to take over the remaining 7 1/2 months of my lease, move out of my apartment, and store all my stuff.
    Since internet and other communications are potentially unreliable at the pole, I will be trying to get all of my financial things automated
    before I leave so hopefully nothing has to be dealt with.  This is mostly true of how I have things already, but there's some unusualy odds 
    and ends that arise because of the length of time I'll be gone.  For instance, I'll be away not only during normal tax-filing season, but also
    I'll <em>still</em> be gone 6 months later when a normal tax filing extension would end.  One of my credit cards is set to expire while I'm gone, 
    so I'll have to ask them to issue a replacement early.  I'll have to figure out how to renew my car's registration remotely when it expires in August.  
    Lots of weird little odds and ends like that.  Just in case I miss something important, or if something unanticipated comes up, I've given one of 
    my family members power of attorney, so they can help out with any miscellaneous things that come up that I can't fix myself remotely.  
    
    I've also got to pack four different sets of things.  First, there's the stuff that goes into storage... that's most of my stuff.  Then there's the obvious: stuff that
    I'm bringing to the pole with me.  In addition to that, there's an opportunity to leave things in Christchirch at the CDC (clothing distribution center) where they issue 
    all the cold weather gear, so I'll probably want to leave a small amount of summer clothes or other items that I'll want for my stay in NZ or for the travel days to- 
    and from- the US, but won't want on the ice.  Finally, there's stuff I need to leave with my parents in Cincinnati.  When I return to the US, I'll be returning to Madison
    briefly to defend my thesis, and then moving to wherever I end up for my next job, so I may not be moving into a
    some basics in Cincy, so I can get by couch-, hotel-, or AirB&B- hopping in the midwestern winter.  
    permanent apartment for a month or more after I get back, which means I might not see the stuff I put in storage for a month or more.  So I'll have to make sure I leave
